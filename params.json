{"name":"JavaScript Learning Project","tagline":"Calculator , Portable sandbag, Javascript, CSS, HTML","body":"### Learn by Doing.\r\nIn order to learn to develop Javascript application, it is great to start a small project. In this repository, I have attached a gif image to show how it works on WordPress.\r\n\r\n### Basic idea for barbell calculator\r\nFor this practice, it is called barbell calculator. It is used to calculate the sandbags you need to put if you want to obtain certain weight. And the basic idea is that it uses inner bag to build a sandbag. In the software, each rectangle mean a sandbag. And three internal bags would be a external bag and sandbags with same color are in the same external bags.\r\n\r\nAfter the calculation, we could know how many sandbags we need to use and the weight for each sandbag.\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\nThere are three files: Javascript file, CSS file, HTML file. These three are the basic components for web applications. And in order to do calculation, it incorporates Jquery to find the DOM elements and deal with it using Javascript. And also it uses Bootstrap for setting page, which is a very easy way to get professional CSS code.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this code?
